SYNOPSIS
       glakkeclock [-options]

DESCRIPTION
       glakkeclock  is  mainly a wrapper around the (ADL) AMD Display Library,
       and makes it easier to get and set GPU setting such as GPU speed,  mem‐
       ory speed, vddc/volt and fan speed.

OPTIONS
   Program options
       -h, --help
              Help dialog.

       -v, --version
              Version.

       -d, --debug
              Toggle debug messages.

       -c --color
              Toggle colored messages.



   Device options
       -Cdn, --device-name
              Choose a device by name.  This device will be subject of all set
              and get options. If duplicate device names exist on system, this
              will result in an error. By default all devices will be used.

       -Cdu, --device-udid
              Choose  a  device by UDID (Universally unique identifier).  This
              device will be subject of all set and get options. The  UDID  is
              unique  for each device, and will work correctly on systems that
              have devices with the same names. By default all devices will be
              used.

       -Cdi, --device-index
              Choose  a  device  by index.  This device will be subject of all
              set and get options. The index is set by  glakkeclock  and  will
              always  be the same, unless adding or removing devices from sys‐
              tem. The index is often (always?) the  order  the  devices  were
              found by kernel.  By default all devices will be used.

       -Cpl, --perf-level
              Choose  a performance level. This performance level will be sub‐
              ject of all set and get options, and performance level  specific
              options.  Valid  values are integers between 0 and the amount of
              performance levels on the device minus one. By default the  cur‐
              rently active performance level will be used.

       -Cai, --poll-adapter
              This  will  enable  reading  values from the default performance
              levels. The default performance levels are set  by  device  BIOS
              and/or device drivers.

       -Cil, --ignore-limits
              Disables  any  limit checks when clocking or changing fan speed.
              By default glakkeclock won't allow going above or below  limits.
              The  limits are chosen by device BIOS and or/drivers, and trying
              to set values above or below these limits will often not be pos‐
              sible.

       -Cal, --all-cards
              Enables  setting  values  on  all  devices  at  once. By default
              glakkeclock won't allow setting  values  on  multiple  cards  at
              once.

       -Cpmi, --poll-min
              Enable reading minimum values.

       -Cpma, --poll-max
              Enable reading maximum values.



   Hardware values
       -HGdc, --get-devices
              Amount of devices.

       -HGi, --get-info
              A lot of device information.

       -HGil, --get-info-levels
              A lot of device information including all performance levels.

       -HGn, --get-name
              Device name.

       -HGu, --get-udid
              Device UDID (Universally unique identifier).

       -HGin, --get-index
              Device index.

       -HGp, --get-part
              Device part number.

       -HGv, --get-version
              Device version.

       -HGd, --get-date
              Device date.




   Frequencies and temperature
       -OGpl, --get-perf-level
              Device's current performance level.

       -OGcg, --get-clocks-gpu
              GPU frequency. Value returned will depend on other parameters.

       -OGcm, --get-clocks-mem
              Memory  frequency.  Value  returned will depend on other parame‐
              ters.

       -OGcv, --get-clocks-vddc
              VDDC/Volt. Value returned will depend on other parameters.

       -OGga, --get-gpu-activity
              GPU activity.

       -OGct, --get-gpu-temp
              GPU temperature.



   Fan
       -OCft, --fan-type
              Choose fan type for getting and setting fan values.

       -OGf, --get-fan
              Fan speed.

       -OSf, --set-fan
              Set fan speed.



   Overclocking
       -OStcs, --toggle-clocks-smooth
              On some  tested  devices  the  performance  levels'  values  are
              required  to  go  from  lowest to highest.  Enabling this option
              automatically force lower performance levels to  have  lower  or
              equal  values,  and  higher performance levels to have higher or
              equal values.

       -OScg, --set-clocks-gpu
              Set GPU frequency.

       -OScm, --set-clocks-mem
              Set Memory frequency.

       -OScv, --set-clocks-vddc
       -OScvr, --set-clocks-vddc-reset
              Reset VDDC/Volt.

       -OSpr, --set-perf-reset
              Reset all clocks on current performance level.

       -OSpar, --set-perf-all-reset
              Reset all clocks on all performance levels.

       -OSar, --set-all-reset
              Reset all clocks on all performance levels, and fan speed.


EXAMPLES
       Long argument names will be use for clarity, short argument names  work
       exactly the same way.

       --device-name 'ATI Radeon HD 4870' --get-index
              The index of a specific device.

       --device-index 0 --get-clocks-gpu --toggle-perf --perf-level 2
              Returns  the performance level 2's GPU frequency, on device with
              index 0.

       --poll-max --device-udid '256:37952:4098:9281:5762' --get-clocks-mem
              Returns the maximum frequency possible  of  memory  on  specific
              device.

       --get-fan --fan-type RPM
              Return fan speed value by RPM.

       --device-index 0 --set-clocks-gpu 675 -Cpl 0
              Set  GPU  clock  to  675 MHz, on performance level 0. This could
              fail if the value is higher than higher performance levels.

       --device-index 0 --set-clocks-vddc 1263 -Cpl 1 --toggle-clocks-smooth
              Set VDDC to 1263 mV on performance level 1.  Lower  perf  levels
              will  have  lower  or  equal value, higher perf levels will have
              higher or equal value.

       --set-clocks-mem 975 --all-cards --toggle-perf
              Set memory prequency of currently active  performance  level  to
              975 MHz, on all cards/devices.


       It is also possible to set multiple values.

       --device-index  0  --set-clocks-gpu  390  --set-clocks-mem  475  --set-
       clocks-vddc 1083 --toggle-clocks-smooth
              Set current performance level values accordingly, and make  sure
              performance levels' values are in order.
