SYNOPSIS
       glakkeclock [-options]

DESCRIPTION
       glakkeclock is mainly a wrapper around the (ADL) AMD Display Library, and makes it easier to get and set GPU setting such as GPU speed, memory speed, vddc/volt and fan speed.

OPTIONS
   Program options
       -h, --help
              Help dialog.

       -v, --version
              Version.

       -d, --debug
              Toggle debug messages.

       -c --color
              Toggle colored messages.



   Device options
       -Cdn, --device-name
              Choose  a  device  by  name.  This device will be subject of all set and get options. If duplicate device names exist on system, this will result in an error. By default all devices will be
              used.

       -Cdu, --device-udid
              Choose a device by UDID (Universally unique identifier).  This device will be subject of all set and get options. The UDID is unique for each device, and will work correctly on systems that
              have devices with the same names. By default all devices will be used.

       -Cdi, --device-index
              Choose  a  device by index.  This device will be subject of all set and get options. The index is set by glakkeclock and will always be the same, unless adding or removing devices from sys‐
              tem. The index is often (always?) the order the devices were found by kernel.  By default all devices will be used.

       -Cpl, --perf-level
              Choose a performance level. This performance level will be subject of all set and get options, and performance level specific options. Valid values are integers between 0 and the amount  of
              performance levels on the device minus one. By default the currently active performance level will be used.

       -Cai, --poll-adapter
              Each  device  can consist of multiple logical adapters (often depending on the amount of display outputs). By default adapter index 0 will be used for getting and setting device options. If
              the user would like to try another adapter index - which often won't make a difference - valid options are 0 to the amount of logical adapters on the device minus one.

       -Ctp, --toggle-perf
              This will enable reading values from the performance level instead of currently active vales. However, often reading from the currently active performance level will be the same as the cur‐
              rently active values.

       -Ctdp, --toggle-def-perf
              This will enable reading values from the default performance levels. The default performance levels are set by device BIOS and/or device drivers.

       -Cil, --ignore-limits
              Disables  any limit checks when clocking or changing fan speed. By default glakkeclock won't allow going above or below limits. The limits are chosen by device BIOS and or/drivers, and try‐

       -HGdc, --get-devices
              Amount of devices.

       -HGi, --get-info
              A lot of device information.

       -HGil, --get-info-levels
              A lot of device information including all performance levels.

       -HGn, --get-name
              Device name.

       -HGu, --get-udid
              Device UDID (Universally unique identifier).

       -HGin, --get-index
              Device index.

       -HGp, --get-part
              Device part number.

       -HGv, --get-version
              Device version.

       -HGd, --get-date
              Device date.

       -HGa, --get-adapters
              Amount of logical adapters on device.



   Bus
       -HGbl, --get-bus-lanes
              PCI-E bus lanes.

       -HGlm, --get-bus-lanes-max
              Max PCI-E bus lanes.

       -HGbs, --get-bus-speed
              PCI-E bus speed.



   Frequencies and temperature
       -OGpl, --get-perf-level
              Device's current performance level.

       -OGcg, --get-clocks-gpu
              GPU frequency. Value returned will depend on other parameters.

       -OGcm, --get-clocks-mem
       -OCft, --fan-type
              Choose fan type for getting and setting fan values.

       -OGf, --get-fan
              Fan speed.

       -OSf, --set-fan
              Set fan speed.



   Overclocking
       -OStcs, --toggle-clocks-smooth
              On some tested devices the performance levels' values are required to go from lowest to highest.  Enabling this option automatically force lower performance levels to have  lower  or  equal
              values, and higher performance levels to have higher or equal values.

       -OScg, --set-clocks-gpu
              Set GPU frequency.

       -OScm, --set-clocks-mem
              Set Memory frequency.

       -OScv, --set-clocks-vddc
              Set VDDC/Volt.



   Reset to defaults
       -OSfr, --set-fan-reset
              Reset fan speed.

       -OScgr, --set-clocks-gpu-reset
              Reset GPU frequency.

       -OScmr, --set-clocks-mem-reset
              Reset Memory frequency.

       -OScvr, --set-clocks-vddc-reset
              Reset VDDC/Volt.

       -OSpr, --set-perf-reset
              Reset all clocks on current performance level.

       -OSpar, --set-perf-all-reset
              Reset all clocks on all performance levels.

       -OSar, --set-all-reset
              Reset all clocks on all performance levels, and fan speed.


EXAMPLES
       Long argument names will be use for clarity, short argument names work exactly the same way.
              Set GPU clock to 675 MHz, on performance level 0. This could fail if the value is higher than higher performance levels.

       --device-index 0 --set-clocks-vddc 1263 --perf-level 1 --toggle-clocks-smooth
              Set VDDC to 1263 mV on performance level 1. Lower perf levels will have lower or equal value, higher perf levels will have higher or equal value.

       --set-clocks-mem 975 --all-cards --toggle-perf
              Set memory prequency of currently active performance level to 975 MHz, on all cards/devices.


       It is also possible to set multiple values.

       --device-index 0 --set-clocks-gpu 390 --set-clocks-mem 475 --set-clocks-vddc 1083 --toggle-clocks-smooth
              Set current performance level values accordingly, and make sure performance levels' values are in order.

       --device-index 1 --set-fan 35 --fan-type Percent
              Set fan speed to 35 %.

       --device-index 0 --set-fan 2000 --fan-type RPM
              Set fan speed to 2000 RPM. This is NOT recommended, see --fan-type Percent above.

       --device-index 0 --get-fan --fan-type RPM
              Return fan speed in RPM.
